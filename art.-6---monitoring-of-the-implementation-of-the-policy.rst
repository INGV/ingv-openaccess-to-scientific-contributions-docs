Art. 6 - Monitoring of the implementation of the policy
=======================================================

The Commission constantly monitors the proper implementation of this
policy, both with reference to filing and publishing the Contributions
in the institutional Archive, and with reference to the open-access
Publications published in its journals. By 31 December every year, the
Commission produces a report on the implementation status of this
policy, suggesting corrective and supplementary actions aimed at
improving its effectiveness.

Through the Commission, the Body promotes the execution of agreements
with publishers aimed at the broadest possibility of quickly
distributing the results of the research via the institutional
Earth-prints archive.

Aided by the Commission, the Coordination Office organizes periodic
training initiatives on Open Access, aimed at the Authors, as well as
public events, such as conferences and seminars raising awareness of the
principle of Open Access, while at the same time promoting its
institutional Earth-prints archive.
