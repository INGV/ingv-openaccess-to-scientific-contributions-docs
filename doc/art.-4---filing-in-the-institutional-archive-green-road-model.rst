Art. 4 - Filing in the institutional archive, “Green Road” model
================================================================

At the moment when the Author becomes aware of the publication of his or
her Contribution by a journal or other publishing venue, or of the
acceptance thereof by the publisher, he or she is required to initiate
the Contribution filing process, following the indications reported on
the Earth-Prints website, by no later than 18 months after the first
publication, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4 of Law no.
112/2013.

The Author is required to be informed as to which rights it has
transferred to the publisher, before proceeding with filing the
Contribution.

Upon entering the Contribution into the institutional Archive, the
Author:

-  declares having complied with the constraints signed in the agreement
   made with the publisher;

-  provides indications on immediate accessibility or inaccessibility
   (e.g.: embargo period) of the contribution, and must completely
   accept the terms and conditions established in the Earth-prints
   licence;

The Commission reserves the right to periodically verify and monitor
that the filing procedures are correct.

INGV shall do all in its power to make all the Contributions filed in
the Archive open access.

If the publishing digital version cannot be made public, the Author
files, in the institutional Archive, the “peer-reviewed digital version”
of the Contribution.
